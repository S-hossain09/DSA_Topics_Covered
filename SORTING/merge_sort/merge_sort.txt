Merge Sort.

In Merge Sort, We need to Remember
               
            Divide & Merge.

Suppose we have an array :

[3,1,2,4,1,5,2,6,4]

In Merge sort , The arr will be divided in 2 parts.
It will be size/2.

As this arr is of 9 size. So it will be spllited in 
4 / 5 parts like 
 
 4 parts    5 parts
[3,1,2,4] [1,5,2,6,4] 
        or

5 / 4 parts.
  5 parts    4 parts
[3,1,2,4,1] [5,2,6,4]

We will be taking the 5 / 4 division according to our will.

We will take the left part and divide it again 

[3,1,2] [4,1]

As we took 5/4 division , we will follow this bigger/smaller
pattern for others division as well.

Again we will divide [3,1,2]

[3,1] [2]

again

[3] [1].

As we cannot divide we will stop here. 
Means we will continue to divide until we reach these single elems

Then we will merge this [3] and [1] in an array. 
But insert in a sorted way. 

it will be like [1,3]

Now we will go back. when we go back we [2] is single elem
so we will merge [2] with [1,3] and insert in a sorted order.

         [1,3]      [2]
        sorted
          arr

The arr will be : 

        [1,2,3]
