Bubble Sort Works Like this:

* Pushes the maximum element to the last
*by adjacent swaps.

What is adjacent swaps ?
* It compares between the element which is current 
beside . It doesn't compare with the whole element.
It just compare with the element adjacent or next to
it.

Now suppose we have elements like this :

        13, 46, 24, 52, 20, 9

Step 1: It will check which is the larger betn 
        13, 46 obviously it is 46. So it will remain
as it is.

Step 2: It will check which is the larger betn 
        46, 24 obviously it is 46. So it will swap
the number and keep the rest as it is:

        13, 24, 46 , 52, 20, 9

Step 3: Now It will check which is the larger betn 
        46, 52 obviously it is 52. So it will remain
as it is.

Step 4: Now It will check which is the larger betn 
        52, 20 obviously it is 52. So it will swap
the number and keep the rest as it is:

        13, 24, 46 , 20, 52, 9

Step 5: Now It will check which is the larger betn 
        52, 9 obviously it is 52. So it will swap
the number and keep the rest as it is:

        13, 24, 46 , 20, 9, 52

Now we can say 52 is at the place where its supposed
to be. Now we have to check numbers before 52.

Step 6: Start all over again . and continue till the
sorted number . in this case 52.

Step 6: It will check which is the larger betn 
        13, 24 obviously it is 24.So it will remain
as it is. 

Step 7: It will check which is the larger betn 
        24, 46 obviously it is 46. So it will swap
the number and keep the rest as it is:

        13, 46, 24, 20, 9, 52

        It will continue it every part is sorted.

At the end we will get :

        9, 13, 20, 24, 46, 52
